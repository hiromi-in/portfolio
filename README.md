Hi!
Thank you for visiting my page.

I am Hiromi from Japan. I am currently a data engineer.
Although I love my current job (especially because my teammates are super smart and kind), I would like to pursue my career more towards the web development field.

I am not a native English speaker but codes are universal and unlike English there are only limited numbers of grammars. I really love that! haha

I am such a visual person. I used to be a salesperson in an IT company and I created lots of visual materials on the internet.
So I really like the idea of creating visuals on the screen.

If you are interested, please take a look at this portfolio. I gathered my experiences and projects I worked on.

Thank you!
